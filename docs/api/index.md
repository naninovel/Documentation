# API Reference

Script commands API reference. Use the side bar to quickly navigate between available commands. 

~~Strikethrough~~ indicates a nameless parameter, and **bold** stands for required parameter; other parameters should be considered optional. Consult [naninovel scripts guide](/guide/naninovel-scripts.md) in case you have no idea what's this all about.

The following parameters are supported by all the script commands:

<div class="config-table">

ID | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
if | String |  A boolean [script expression](/guide/script-expressions.md), controlling whether the command should execute.
wait | Boolean | Whether the script player should wait for the async command to finish execution before executing the next one. Has no effect when the command is executed instantly.

## animate

#### Summary
Animate properties of the actors with the specified IDs via key frames. Key frames for the animated parameters are delimited with `|` literals.

#### Remarks
It's not recommended to use this command for complex animations. Naniscript is a scenario scripting DSL and not suited for complex automation or specification such as animation. Consider using dedicated animation tools instead, such as Unity's [Animator](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AnimationSection.html). <br /><br /> Be aware, that this command searches for actors with the provided IDs over all the actor managers, and in case multiple actors with the same ID exist (eg, a character and a text printer), this will affect only the first found one. <br /><br /> When running the animate commands in parallel (`wait` is set to false) the affected actors state can mutate unpredictably. This could cause unexpected results when rolling back or performing other commands that affect state of the actor. Make sure to reset affected properties of the animated actors (position, tint, appearance, etc) after the command finishes or use `@animate CharacterId` (without any args) to stop the animation prematurely.

#### Parameters

<div class="config-table">

ID | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
<span class="command-param-nameless command-param-required" title="Nameless parameter: value should be provided after the command identifier without specifying parameter ID  Required parameter: parameter should always be specified">actorIds</span> | string list | IDs of the actors to animate.
loop | boolean | Whether to loop the animation; make sure to set `wait` to false when loop is enabled, otherwise script playback will loop indefinitely.
appearance | string | Appearances to set for the animated actors.

posY | string | Position values over Y-axis (in 0 to 100 range, in percents from the bottom border of the scene) to set for the animated actors.
posZ | string | Position values over Z-axis (in world space) to set for the animated actors; while in ortho mode, can only be used for sorting.
rotation | string | Rotation values (over Z-axis) to set for the animated actors.
scale | string | Scale (`x,y,z` or a single uniform value) to set for the animated actors.
tint | string | Tint colors to set for the animated actors. <br /><br /> Strings that begin with `#` will be parsed as hexadecimal in the following way: `#RGB` (becomes RRGGBB), `#RRGGBB`, `#RGBA` (becomes RRGGBBAA), `#RRGGBBAA`; when alpha is not specified will default to FF. <br /><br /> Strings that do not begin with `#` will be parsed as literal colors, with the following supported: red, cyan, blue, darkblue, lightblue, purple, yellow, lime, fuchsia, white, silver, grey, black, orange, brown, maroon, green, olive, navy, teal, aqua, magenta.

</div>

#### Example
```nani
; Animate `Kohaku` actor over three animation steps (key frames),
; changing positions: first step will take 1, second — 0.5 and third — 3 seconds.
@animate Kohaku posX:50|0|85 time:1|0.5|3

; Start loop animations of `Yuko` and `Kohaku` actors; notice, that you can skip
; key values indicating that the parameter shouldn't change during the animation step.
@animate Kohaku,Yuko loop:true appearance:Surprise|Sad|Default|Angry transition:DropFade|Ripple|Pixelate posX:15|85|50 posY:0|-25|-85 scale:1|1.25|1.85 tint:#25f1f8|lightblue|#ffffff|olive easing:EaseInBounce|EaseInQuad time:3|2|1|0.5 wait:false

...
; Here we're going to set a specific position for the character,
; but the animation could still be running in background, so reset it first.
@animate Kohaku
; Now it's safe to modify previously animated properties.
@char Kohaku pos:50 scale:1
```

## append

#### Summary

; then append the end of the sentence at once.
Lorem ipsum
@append " dolor sit amet."
```

## arrange

#### Summary
Arranges specified characters by X-axis. When no parameters provided, will execute an auto-arrange evenly distributing visible characters by X-axis.

#### Parameters

<div class="config-table">

ID | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
<span class="command-param-nameless" title="Nameless parameter: value should be provided after the command identifier without specifying parameter ID">characterPositions</span> | named decimal list | A collection of character ID to scene X-axis position (relative to the left scene border, in percents) named values. Position 0 relates to the left border and 100 to the right border of the scene; 50 is the center.

```

## back

#### Summary
Modifies a [background actor](/guide/backgrounds.md).

#### Remarks
Backgrounds are handled a bit differently from characters to better accommodate traditional VN game flow. Most of the time you'll probably have a single background actor on scene, which will constantly transition to different appearances. To remove the hassle of repeating same actor ID in scripts, it's possible to provide only the background appearance and transition type (optional) as a nameless parameter assuming `MainBackground` actor should be affected. When this is not the case, ID of the background actor can be explicitly provided via the `id` parameter.

## gosub

#### Summary
Navigates naninovel script playback to the provided path and saves that path to global state; [@return] commands use this info to redirect to command after the last invoked gosub command.

#### Remarks
Designed to serve as a function (subroutine) in a programming language, allowing to reuse a piece of naninovel script. It's possible to declare a gosub outside of the currently played script and use it from any other scripts, which could be useful for invoking a repeating set of commands multiple times.

#### Parameters

<div class="config-table">

<span class="command-param-nameless command-param-required" title="Nameless parameter: value should be provided after the command identifier without specifying parameter ID  Required parameter: parameter should always be specified">path</span> | named string | Path to navigate into in the following format: `ScriptName.LabelName`. When label name is omitted, will play provided script from the start. When script name is omitted, will attempt to find a label in the currently played script.
reset | string list | When specified, will reset the engine services state before loading a script (in case the path is leading to another script). Specify `*` to reset all the services, or specify service names to exclude from reset. By default, the state does not reset.

</div>

#### Example
```nani
; Navigate the playback to the label `VictoryScene` in the currently played script,
; executes the commands and navigates back to the command after the `gosub`.
@gosub .VictoryScene
...
@stop
# VictoryScene
@back Victory
@sfx Fireworks
@bgm Fanfares
You are victorious!
@return

; Another example with some branching inside the subroutine.
@set time=10
; Here we get one result.
@gosub .Room
...
@set time=3
; And here we get another.
@gosub .Room
@stop
# Room

If a variable with the provided name doesn't exist, it will be automatically created. <br /><br /> It's possible to define multiple set expressions in one line by separating them with `;`. The expressions will be executed in sequence by the order of declaration. <br /><br /> In case variable name starts with `T_` or `t_` it's considered a reference to a value stored in 'Script' [managed text](/guide/managed-text.md) document. Such variables can't be assigned and mostly used for referencing localizable text values.

#### Parameters

<div class="config-table">

ID | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
<span class="command-param-nameless command-param-required" title="Nameless parameter: value should be provided after the command identifier without specifying parameter ID  Required parameter: parameter should always be specified">expression</span> | string | Set expression. <br /><br /> The expression should be in the following format: `VariableName=ExpressionBody`, where `VariableName` is the name of the custom variable to assign and `ExpressionBody` is a [script expression](/guide/script-expressions.md), the result of which should be assigned to the variable. <br /><br /> It's also possible to use increment and decrement unary operators (`@set foo++`, `@set foo--`) and compound assignment (`@set foo+=10`, `@set foo-=3`, `@set foo*=0.1`, `@set foo/=2`).

</div>

#### Example
```nani
; Assign `foo` variable a `bar` string value.
@set foo="bar"

; Assign `foo` variable a 1 number value.
@set foo=1

; Assign `foo` variable a `true` boolean value.
@set foo=true

; If `foo` is a number, add 0.5 to its value.
@set foo+=0.5

@set bar="Hello World!"
@set foo=bar

; Defining multiple set expressions in one line (the result will be the same as above).
@set bar="Hello World!";foo=bar

; It's possible to inject variables to naninovel script command parameters.
@set scale=0
# EnlargeLoop
@char Kohaku.Default scale:{scale}
@set scale+=0.1
@goto .EnlargeLoop if:scale<1

; ...and generic text lines.

## sfx

#### Summary
Plays or modifies currently played [SFX (sound effect)](/guide/audio.md#sound-effects) track with the provided name.

#### Remarks
Sound effect tracks are not looped by default. When sfx track name (SfxPath) is not specified, will affect all the currently played tracks. When invoked for a track that is already playing, the playback won't be affected (track won't start playing from the start), but the specified parameters (volume and whether the track is looped) will be applied.

#### Parameters

<div class="config-table">

ID | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
<span class="command-param-nameless" title="Nameless parameter: value should be provided after the command identifier without specifying parameter ID">sfxPath</span> | string | Path to the sound effect asset to play.
volume | decimal | Volume of the sound effect.
loop | boolean | Whether to play the sound effect in a loop.
fade | decimal | Duration of the volume fade-in when starting playback, in seconds (0.0 by default); doesn't have effect when modifying a playing track.
group | string | Audio mixer [group path](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Audio.AudioMixer.FindMatchingGroups) that should be used when playing the audio.
time | decimal | Duration (in seconds) of the modification.

</div>

#### Example
```nani
; Plays an SFX with the name `Explosion` once.

@sfx Rain loop:true fade:30

; Changes volume of all the played SFX tracks to 75% over 2.5 seconds
; and disables looping for all of them.
@sfx volume:0.75 loop:false time:2.5
```

## sfxFast

#### Summary
Plays an [SFX (sound effect)](/guide/audio.md#sound-effects) track with the provided name. Unlike [@sfx] command, the clip is played with minimum delay and is not serialized with the game state (won't be played after loading a game, even if it was played when saved). The command can be used to play various transient audio clips, such as UI-related sounds (eg, on button click with [`Play Script` component](/guide/user-interface.md#play-script-on-unity-event)).

#### Parameters

<div class="config-table">

ID | Type | Description
