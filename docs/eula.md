# End User License Agreement

This End User License Agreement ("EULA") is a non-exclusive, legally binding end user license agreement between any individual or a single entity ("END-USER") that acquires a license to Naninovel — Visual Novel Engine ("Asset") by ReWaffle LLC ("Licensor").

Please read this End-User License Agreement ("Agreement") carefully before downloading or using Naninovel — Visual Novel Engine ("Application").

By downloading or using the Application, END-USER agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

If END-USER does not agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not download or use the Application.

The subject matter of this EULA is the licensing to END-USER of any Application. The Application is licensed, not sold.

## License

Licensor grants END-USER a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to download, install and use the Application for personal and commercial purposes in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

## END-USER's Rights and Obligations

END-USER may use the licensed Assets only for their intended purpose.

Licensor grants to the END-USER a non-exclusive, worldwide, and perpetual license to the Asset to integrate it only as incorporated and embedded components of electronic games and digital media and distribute such electronic game and digital media; reproduction and display in distributed physical advertising materials is permitted solely for marketing purposes in respect of such electronic games or digital media. Except for game services software development kits ("Services SDKs"), END-USERS may modify Assets. END-USER may otherwise not reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, distribute, sublicense, rent, lease or lend the Assets. It is emphasized that the END-USERS shall not be entitled to distribute or transfer in any way (including, without, limitation by way of sublicense) the Assets in any other way than as integrated components of electronic games and digital media or in supporting physical marketing materials. Without limitation of the foregoing it is emphasized that END-USER shall not be entitled to share the costs related to purchasing an Asset and then let any third party that has contributed to such purchase use such Asset (forum pooling).

END-USER is granted a single seat license to install and use the Asset only on a maximum of 2 computers. For the avoidance of doubt, the Asset is licensed on a per seat basis and may not be shared or used concurrently on more than 2 different computers. As an exception, build farm servers and virtual machine instances used only for running, testing, or building projects with the Asset do not require separate seat license(s) or constitute use on more than 2 different computers.

An END-USER may use the Asset and may have a third party, including any "work-for-hire" contractor or "freelancer" ("Contractor"), work on that Asset on its behalf. However, any Contractor working on a project for an END-USER must have license(s) of its own to the Asset. Conversely, to use the Asset, a person must have its own license to the Asset, regardless of whether a Contractor working on a project for that person had its own license to that Asset. For example, a person who is a Contractor must have a seat license for the Asset, and the persons who is hirer of the Contractor must have a seat license for the Asset.

END-USER shall pay for the license to the Assets in accordance with the payment process provided on this website. END USER shall provide customary billing and tax information such as name, billing address, credit card information and VAT number (for EU residents). END USER agrees to pay for all purchases hereby authorizes the collection of such amounts including applicable taxes by charging the credit card provided, either directly by ReWaffle LLC or indirectly, via a third party online payment processor. VAT numbers cannot be added or changed after the purchase is completed. If you are directed to a third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s Privacy Policy. Please review such third party’s terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services.

Some components of the Asset (whether developed by ReWaffle LLC or third parties) may also be governed by applicable open source software licenses. In the event of a conflict between the applicable EULA and any such open source licenses, the open source software licenses shall prevail with respect to those components.

You agree that no modification or use of those Assets shall (a) infringe, misappropriate, or violate a third party’s patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, moral rights, or other intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy; (b) violate, or encourage any conduct that would violate, any applicable law or regulation or would give rise to liability of any kind; (c) be fraudulent, false, misleading, or deceptive; (d) promote discrimination, bigotry, racism, hatred, harassment, or harm against any individual or group; (e) promote violence or actions that are threatening to any other person; or (f) promote illegal or harmful activities or substances.

All sales are final and there shall be no refunds except as required by law.

On acceptance of END-USER orders for licenses to the Asset, content will be immediately available for download. END-USERS expressly consent to the making available of that content immediately upon acceptance of orders. If END-USER is a resident of the European Union and purchases any license to any Asset, the right to withdraw from such purchase within 14 days of the date of purchase ("Cooling Off Period") may be available; however, this right of withdrawal will not apply where performance begins before the end of the Cooling Off Period. Therefore, END-USERS expressly agree and understand that if END-USER orders any license to any Asset, END-USER’s right of withdrawal is forfeited upon acceptance as performance begins immediately on acceptance.

This Agreement will terminate immediately, without prior notice from Licensor, in the event that END-USER fails to comply with any provision of this Agreement. END-USER may also terminate this Agreement by deleting the Application and all copies thereof from END-USER’s devices.

Upon termination of this Agreement, END-USER shall cease all use of the Application and delete all copies of the Application.
