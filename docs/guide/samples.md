# Samples

A collection of example projects are provided to help you get started with common development scenarios. Read on for instructions to access the samples and brief descriptions of each.

## Accessing Samples

The samples are hosted on a private GitHub repository: [github.com/naninovel/samples](https://github.com/naninovel/samples). To access the repository, [register your Naninovel license](https://naninovel.com/register) and follow the dashboard instructions to assign a GitHub user. Once you have access, either [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) or [download](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the repository.

Open the repository directory with the Unity editor. Notice that Naninovel and some other packages are referenced as Git packages in the package manager, so ensure a Git client is installed on your machine. Without it, Unity won't be able to pull the packages; refer to the UPM guide for [more info on Git packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html).

To use the referenced Naninovel package, you must be authenticated as the GitHub user assigned in the account dashboard. Refer to the Unity guide for [more info on authentication](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-config-https-git.html). Alternatively, you can remove the Git package reference and install Naninovel from the Asset Store instead.
