# Custom Actor Shader

When rendering most of the actors (characters and backgrounds, except generic ones) a special shader is used to handle semi-transparency overdraw and support various transition effects.

You can override the default shader by assigning a custom one to `Custom Texture Shader` property available in the actor configuration menu.

Be aware, that the shader is expected to have specific properties; check default shader `Naninovel/Resources/Naninovel/Shaders/TransitionalTexture` for a reference.

When actor is represented as a sprite on a scene, `Custom Sprite Shader` property is available (the case for non-generic implementations when they're not rendered to texture). By default, a simple unlit transparent shader is used; in case you want to implement lighting or surface effects, assign a custom shader to the property.

::: tip EXAMPLE
Check the sample on GitHub for an example on how to create and use [texture shader](https://github.com/naninovel/samples/blob/main/unity/shader/Assets/Shaders/CustomTexture.shader) for adding custom transition effects and [sprite shader](https://github.com/naninovel/samples/blob/main/unity/shader/Assets/Shaders/CustomSprite.shader) with lighting and self-illumination support to simulate time of day for a background actor.
