# IDE Extension

IDE features, like syntax highlighting, error checking, auto-completion and interactive documentation could significantly increase productivity when writing [naninovel scripts](/guide/naninovel-scripts). We've made an extension for a free and open-source [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (available for Windows, MacOS and Linux) IDE, which provides the essential IDE support for NaniScript syntax.

## Setup

### Install VS Code Extension

1. Open extensions window in VS Code via `View -> Extensions` menu
2. Search for "Naninovel" and click "Install" button

![](https://i.gyazo.com/b85f1478acde3cad440d1f29f915f395.png)

::: info NOTE
Extension in the VS Code registry is compatible with the current stable Naninovel release. When using a preview release of Naninovel, switch to the pre-release extension stream. When using a final Naninovel release, disable auto-update in VS Code and install associated legacy version of the extension.
:::

### Activate the Extension

1. Make sure [Naninovel is installed](/guide/getting-started#install-naninovel) in the Unity project
2. Open the Unity project folder in VS Code

When the extension detects a `.nani` file in the current workspace, it'll activate the bridging service, which handles the useful tasks, such as diagnosing the scripts, providing auto-completion, indicating which script line is currently played, etc.

### Project Root

By default, Naninovel will generate a `.nani` folder under the Unity project root, where it'll store the project metadata and bridging files required for communication with the authoring tools, such as the VS Code extension. This means, that when opening Naninovel projects with the VS Code, you have to select the folder containing the entire Unity project.

In case you'd like to open just the folder with the scenario scripts or another folder under the Unity project directory, select that folder via `Naninovel Project Root` option in the engine configuration menu.

![](https://i.gyazo.com/0395ca7947559630a025f1c740852d04.png)

When selected, Naninovel will generate the metadata and bridging files under the custom folder, which you can then open with the VS Code as well.

### Scenario Root

The VS Code extension has to be aware where the Naninovel scenario scripts (`.nani` files) are stored, relative to the workspace root. By default, it expects them under `Assets/Scenario` directory:

![](https://i.gyazo.com/3ecbb9440a8e53d4b3d654b15c5ea557.png)

â€” in case you've changed the default in the Unity project configuration and using another directory to store the scrips, change the setting and restart VS Code; otherwise script paths won't be correctly resolved, resulting in navigation warnings and wrong paths shown in auto-completions.

## VS Code Settings

Below is the recommended settings for VS Code to ignore Unity's autogenerated meta files, enable semantic syntax highlighting, word wrap and spell checking (given [spell check extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) is installed) and disable word-based suggestions (so that they don't constantly pop up when you type generic text lines):

```json
{
    "files.exclude": {
        "**/*.meta": true
    },
    "editor.wordWrap": "on",
    "editor.wordBasedSuggestions": "off",
    "editor.occurrencesHighlight": "off",
    "editor.suggest.showWords": false,
    "editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled": false,
    "editor.semanticTokenColorCustomizations": {
        "enabled": true,
        "rules": {
            "CommentLine": { "foreground": "#5d6470", "italic": true },
            "CommentText": { "foreground": "#5d6470", "italic": true },
            "LabelLine": "#9bc37c",
            "LabelText": "#9bc37c",
            "CommandLine": "#6cb2ed",
            "InlinedCommand": "#6cb2ed",
            "Command": "#6cb2ed",
            "CommandIdentifier": "#6cb2ed",
            "Parameter": "#cd9769",
            "ParameterIdentifier": "#cd9769",
            "ParameterValue": "#e2be7f",
            "LocalizableValue": "#acb2be",
            "GenericTextLine": "#acb2be",
            "GenericTextPrefix": "#e2be7f",
            "GenericTextAuthor": "#e2be7f",
            "GenericTextAuthorAppearance": "#e2be7f",
            "Expression": "#62b8c1",
            "TextIdentifier": "#5d6470",
            "WaitFlag": "#6cb2ed",
            "Error": "#d14e4e"
        }
    },
    "cSpell.enableFiletypes": [
        "naniscript"
    ]
}
```

You can access the settings JSON file via `File -> Preference -> Settings` menu and clicking "Open Settings (JSON)" button in the upper-right corner of the window. Select "User" tab to edit settings for all projects or "Workspace" to affect only the current project with the naninovel scripts.

![](https://i.gyazo.com/324d7e4568a066854d6cb8270eb73b6d.png)

Feel free to customize the settings as you see fit.

## Spell Check

To enable spell checking in the naninovel scripts, install a spell checker extension, eg. [Code Spell Check](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) and turn on the checking for `naniscript` language; see the [settings section](/guide/ide-extension#vs-code-settings) below for an example on how to enable naniscript language for the Code Spell Check extension.

## Folding

Following artifacts get folding support by default:

- Labels, until other label
- Joint comment lines
- Indented (nested) blocks

It's also possible to specify custom folding regions via comments with special syntax:

1. Open with `; > region name`, where "region name" can be anything
2. Close with `; < region name`, where "region name" equals the opening name

## Project Metadata

The Naninovel metadata is a JSON file, which contains various information associated with the authored project: available characters, backgrounds, resources, commands, etc. This information is used by the authoring tools, such as the IDE extension and web editor to provide the helpful functions, such as auto-completion and diagnostics.

The metadata file is stored at `.nani/Metadata.json`, under the Unity project root. When `Auto Generate Metadata` is enabled under engine configuration, the metadata is re-generated automatically when editor starts. To update the metadata manually (for example, after adding resources or custom commands), either use `Naninovel -> Update Metadata` editor menu or `Ctrl + Shift + U` hotkey.

### Metadata Providers

To fill generated metadata with additional custom values, implement `IMetadataProvider` interface. The implementations are expected to have a parameterless constructor and will be instantiated and used each time project metadata is generated (eg, when syncing with an IDE extension). The results of each implementation will be merged with each other; this way you can have multiple providers that generate specific metadata.

Below is an example of a built-in metadata provider, that generates script label constants to be used in autocompletion.

```csharp
public class LabelMetadataProvider : IMetadataProvider
{
    public Project GetMetadata (MetadataOptions options)
    {
        var scripts = LoadScripts();
        var constants = scripts.Select(CreateLabelConstant);
        return new Project { Constants = constants.ToArray() };
    }

    private Script[] LoadScripts ()
    {
        return EditorResources.LoadOrDefault()
            .GetAllRecords(ScriptsConfiguration.DefaultPathPrefix)
            .Select(kv => AssetDatabase.GUIDToAssetPath(kv.Value))
            .Where(path => !string.IsNullOrEmpty(path))
            .Select(AssetDatabase.LoadAssetAtPath<Script>)
            .ToArray();
    }

    private Constant CreateLabelConstant (Script script)
    {
        var name = $"Labels/{script.Name}";
        var values = script.Lines
            .OfType<LabelScriptLine>()
            .Where(l => !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(l.LabelText))
            .Select(l => l.LabelText.Trim());
        return new Constant { Name = name, Values = values.ToArray() };
    }
}
```

::: info NOTE
Starting with v1.20 label auto-completion no longer requires metadata sync, hence the above code has been removed from the Naninovel sources, but it's still a valid example on implementing custom metadata providers.
:::

## IDE Attributes

Naninovel has a number of [C# attributes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/attributes) to provide various IDE-related functionality to custom commands and expression functions. For example, to add on-hover documentation to the custom commands and/or parameters, apply `Doc` attribute to command type and parameter fields respectively:

```csharp
[Doc("Summary of the custom command.")]
public class CustomCommand : Command
{
    [Doc("Summary of the custom parameter.")]
    public StringParameter CustomParameter;
}
```

To make a parameter auto-complete with both built-in and custom expression functions and pre-defined custom variables use `ExpressionContext` attribute.

```csharp
[ExpressionContext]
public StringParameter Expression;
```

To auto-complete with values from an arbitrary [enumeration type](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/enum) use `ConstantContext` attribute.

```csharp
[ConstantContext(typeof(PlatformID))]
public StringParameter Platform;
```

To auto-complete and analyze usage and correctness of navigation endpoints (script path and label) use `EndpointContext` attribute.

```csharp
[EndpointContext]
public NamedStringParameter Goto;
```

To auto-complete with a resource use `ResourceContext` and provide path prefix of the resources. Below example will complete with audio resources:

```csharp
[ResourceContext(AudioConfiguration.DefaultAudioPathPrefix)]
public StringParameter Audio;
```

To auto-complete with an actor ID (of any type) use `ActorContext` attribute.

```csharp
[ActorContext]
public StringParameter ActorId;
```

To auto-complete with an actor ID of specific type use `ActorContext` attribute with first argument specifying path prefix of the actor resources. Below will complete with printer IDs:

```csharp
[ActorContext(TextPrintersConfiguration.DefaultPathPrefix)]
public StringParameter PrinterId;
```

To auto-complete appearances of an actor with ID specified in the same named or another parameter in the current command, use `AppearanceContext` attribute. Be aware, that this requires `ActorContext` attribute specified in the same command.

```csharp
[ActorContext(CharactersConfiguration.DefaultPathPrefix)]
public StringParameter CharacterId;
[AppearanceContext]
public StringParameter CharacterAppearance;
```

Notice, that each of the above attributes allows providing an optional `namedIndex` argument. Use it with named parameters to specify for which part of the parameter value the attribute belongs. Below example will allow auto-completing name part of the named parameter with character IDs and value part with appearances for the currently typed character (similar to nameless parameter of [@char] command).

```csharp
[ActorContext(CharactersConfiguration.DefaultPathPrefix, 0), AppearanceContext(1)]
public NamedStringParameter IdAndAppearance;
```

The parameter context attributes can be applied to class instead of fields to allow specifying (or overriding) the contexts for the fields declared in parent classes. For example, while `Id` parameter is declared in the abstract `ModifyActor` command, the context is applied to `ModifyBackground` inherited class:

```csharp
[ActorContext(BackgroundsConfiguration.DefaultPathPrefix, paramId: "Id")]
public class ModifyBackground : ModifyActor { }
```

You can repurpose the same tactic when inheriting custom commands from the built-in ones. Don't forget to provide the optional `paramId` argument when applying parameter context attribute to a class instead of field.

::: tip
Most of the same parameter context attributes can be applied to expression function parameters to make them auto-complete and diagnosed by the IDE extension. Find an example in the [functions guide](/guide/script-expressions#parameter-context).
:::

## Constant Expressions

When using `ConstantContext` IDE Attribute, instead of enum it's possible to specify an expression to be evaluated by the IDE to produce a constant name based on command parameter values or other variables, such as currently inspected script.

Expression syntax:

- Evaluated parts should be wrapped in curly braces (`{}`)
- To reference currently inspected script path, use `$Script`
- To reference parameter value, use `:` followed by the parameter ID (field name as specified in C#, not alias)
- Use `[0]` or `[1]` after parameter reference to specify named value (0 for name and 1 for index)
- Use null coalescing (`??`) after parameter reference for fallback in case the value is not specified
- Use concatenation operator (`+`) to merge values from multiple constants

For example, check the expression assigned to `Path` parameter of the built-in `[@goto]` command:

```csharp
[ConstantContext("Labels/{:Path[0]??$Script}", 1)]
public NamedStringParameter Path;
```

â€” when name component of the parameter is assigned with `foo`, it will evaluate to `Labels/foo`, otherwise, given inspected script path is `bar` it will evaluate to `Labels/bar`.

Another example for character poses applied to `@char` command:

```csharp
[ConstantContext("Poses/Characters/{:Id??:IdAndAppearance[0]}+Poses/Characters/*", paramId: nameof(Pose))]
public class ModifyCharacter { ... }
```

â€” will merge shared character poses with poses for characters with ID assigned to "ID" parameter or (when not assigned) name component of "IdAndAppearance" parameter.

Constant expressions combined with [custom metadata providers](/guide/ide-extension#metadata-providers) allow creating arbitrary autocompletion scenarios for the IDE extension.

## Other IDEs and Editors

While we don't maintain extensions for other editors, we have an open-sourced language server for Naninovel: [github.com/naninovel/language](https://github.com/naninovel/language). It's written in C#, but has JavaScript bindings and can be used in most modern IDEs. The implementation covers syntax highlighting, autocompletion, errors checking, etc. VS Code extension (which is built upon the language server) is open-sourced as well: [github.com/naninovel/vscode](https://github.com/naninovel/vscode).

Alternatively, in case you're using an editor with TextMate grammar support (eg, [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)), we have one ready: [textmate.json](https://github.com/naninovel/docs/blob/main/docs/.vitepress/ext/lang/textmate.json).
