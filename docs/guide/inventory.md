# Inventory

While an inventory system is out of scope for visual novels, we had a lot of requests and questions on how to integrate one with Naninovel. The [GitHub project](https://github.com/Elringus/NaninovelInventory) serves as an example for creating and integrating an inventory extension, which you can set up on top of Naninovel installation without modifying the engine source code.

::: note
The inventory is not a standalone product and/or part of Naninovel. Use it to learn how to extend and customize the engine, but don't expect it to be production-ready solution for inventory systems. If you're looking for one, [check the Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/?q=inventory) or create a custom one from scratch.
:::

Example project shows how to make a custom inventory UI with grid layout, pagination and drag-drop window, add custom engine service and related configuration menu, add input bindings, use state outsourcing, author custom scenario commands and expression functions.

You can [clone the project repository with a Git client](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) or [download it as a zip archive](https://github.com/Naninovel/Inventory/archive/master.zip). 

::: warn
Naninovel package is not distributed with the project, hence compilation errors will be produced after opening it for the first time; import Naninovel from the Asset Store to resolve the issues.

## Installation

To set up inventory extension on top of an existing Unity project use [UPM](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui.html) to install the package via the following git URL: `https://github.com/Naninovel/Inventory.git?path=Assets/NaninovelInventory` or download and import [NaninovelInventory.unitypackage](https://github.com/Naninovel/Inventory/raw/master/NaninovelInventory.unitypackage) manually.

After importing the package, add `Elringus.NaninovelInventory.Runtime` and `Elringus.NaninovelInventory.Editor` records to the `Type Assemblies` list property found in the engine configuration menu and restart Unity editor (otherwise the custom implementation types under the assemblies won't be accessible by Naninovel).

## Usage

To create a pre-made inventory UI from template, use `Create -> Naninovel -> Inventory -> Inventory UI` asset context menu. Then add the prefab to the Naninovel UI resources via `Naninovel -> Resources -> UI` editor menu. Once added, the UI can be shown/hidden like all the other UIs with [@showUI] and [@hideUI] commands.

The Inventory UI component has `Capacity` property, where you can change number of slots in the inventory. Slot grid is configured (slot number and layout, slots per page, etc) via `Content/InventoryGrid` game object. Window drag-drop behavior can be configured (disabled) via `Drag Drop` component attached to `Content` game object.

Inventory item prefabs can be created with `Create -> Naninovel -> Inventory -> Inventory Item` asset context menu. The item prefabs will then need to be assigned as inventory resources via `Naninovel -> Resources -> Inventory` editor menu.

In case you have a lot of items and it's inconvenient to assign them via editor menu, it's possible to just drop them at `Resources/Naninovel/Inventory` folder and they'll automatically be exposed to the engine. You can additionally organize them with sub-folders, if you wish; in this case use forward slashes (`/`) when referencing them in naninovel scripts. Eg, item stored as `Resources/Naninovel/Inventory/Armor/FullPlate.prefab` can be referenced in scripts as `Armor/FullPlate`.

It's also possible to use [addressable asset system](/guide/resource-providers.md#addressable) to manually expose the resources. To expose an asset, assign address equal to the path you'd use to expose it via the method described above, except omit the "Resources/" part. Eg, to expose a "FullPlate.prefab" item, assign the prefab asset following address: `Naninovel/Inventory/FullPlate`. Be aware, that addressable provider is not used in editor by default; you can allow it by enabling `Enable Addressable In Editor` property in resource provider configuration menu.

Each item has a `Stack Count Limit` property to limit how much items of this type can be stacked in a single inventory slot and a `On Item Used` Unity event, which is invoked when the item is used (either via `@useItem` command or when user clicks on the item in the inventory). Below is an example on how you can setup the event with `Play Script` component to remove the item once it used, spawn a glitch special effect and print a text message.

You can add items to the inventory with `@addItem` command and remove with `@removeItem` (or `@removeItemAt`, `@removeAllItems`). Item IDs are equal to the item prefab names. Inventory slot IDs are equal to the grid slot indexes (eg, first slot is 0, second is 1, etc).

`ItemExist()` and `ItemCount()` custom [expression functions](/guide/script-expressions.md#expression-functions) to check wither an items exist in inventory and number of existing items are also available for convenience.

Below is a script from the example project:

```nani
# Start

Select an action.[skipInput]

@choice "Pick up sword" if:!ItemExist("Sword") do:"@addItem Sword, @goto .Adventure"
@choice "Pick up armor" if:!ItemExist("Armor") do:"@addItem Armor, @goto .Adventure"
@choice "Adventure awaits, venture forth!"
@stop

# Adventure

@if ItemExist("Sword")
	@set monstersSlayed="{ItemExist("Armor") ? Random(3,5) : 2}"
	@addItem Food amount:{monstersSlayed}
	You've encountered and slayed {monstersSlayed} monsters with your sword.[if !ItemExist("Armor")] You could've been more productive with an armor, though.[endif][i][showUI Inventory wait:false] Check your inventory for the loot!
	@goto .Start
@else
	But you don't have a weapon! You've been beaten by the monsters.[if ItemExist("Armor")] At least it didn't hurt that much, thanks to the armor.[endif] Let's prepare better next time.
	@goto .Start
@endif
```
