# Contributing Guide

There are several ways to help us improve the documentation (eg, fix a typo or update translation).

## Option 1: Clone, Preview and PR

This is the most involving way, but will allow you to run the docs locally to preview the changes.

1. Install Node.js ([nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org))
2. Fork this repository ([guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo))
3. Install npm dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run local dev server to preview changes while editing: `npm run dev`
5. Create pull request ([guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#making-a-pull-request))

## Option 2: Direct PR

The easiest way to make a PR by editing pages directly in browser.

1. Open the page you want to edit
2. Click "Edit this page on GitHub" found at the bottom-left of each page
3. Proceed with the edits and click "Commit changes" button
4. Follow GitHub instructions on how to make a PR

## Option 3: Ask for Edits

If you're not comfortable with GitHub, just let us know which edits are required either on [Discord](https://discord.gg/BfkNqem) or [forum](https://forum.naninovel.com/).
